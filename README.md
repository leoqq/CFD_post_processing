# CFD_post_processing
This is a repository for different post-processing code for combustion modelling, the output files can come from any combustion code i.e CONVERGE, Openfoam,  or Fluent . The authors have been mainly using CONVERGE. But as long as the file provided is in txt form, these files then can be used for post-processing. Sample case used here is Spray A

# Software requirement 
Most of the code is running on Matlab and occasionally it can be python depending on the usasage 


## How to use this module
For CFD, varius post processing are needed to convert files. Here we present differnt ways to plot graphs using matlab and python
